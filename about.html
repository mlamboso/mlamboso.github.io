				<h1>Oh, hey! I'm Michelle.</h1>
				<p>I recently graduated as Cum Laude from the University of St. La Salle with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Engineering. The curriculum I graduated from required me to undergo five years in college with professional subjects focused in design, development, and integration of software and hardware computing systems components. The curriculum mostly focused on systems running on Windows, introductory classes on Linux, and development of microcontroller systems. My design project, which is an undergraduate thesis equivalent, was about the automation of regulating the conditions in oyster mushroom farming. My team and I developed web and android applications to keep track of farming conditions and develop hardware response to regulate such conditions. I believe this is a relevant and immersive experience with web, mobile, and microcontroller-based systems development. <br><br>I believe I am suitable and able for roles in developing, designing, and testing both software and hardware systems. I am also equipped with knowledge on principles of digital communication, logic circuits analysis, and networking. I am experienced in using programs such as Microsoft Office and Adobe. The nature of work I was exposed to, having been an active student leader in college and an efficient intern in a business process outsourcing company, has equipped me with skills and knowledge I can contribute as an efficient and enthusiastic worker.  </p>

				<h1>In a Nutshell</h1>
				<p>The words I wrote for the yearbook publication couldn’t be more accurate. “The experiences we had in the past years with this University will become our anchor as we cross to the unpredictable future.” And boy, how unpredictable is the world today? I once had a planner called “Design your Life.” Besides the section for daily planner, there were also pages reserved for writing yearly goals, recognizing fears, determining monthly milestones, tracking savings and expenses. I bet no planner can help me design my life now. I can only hope to stay determined and focused. This is what “20/20 Vision” to be all about. It gives a call to maintain a clear view in the midst of the chaos – to stay focused. <br><br>I would like to develop a healthy conversation among my peers - this year's graduates who are feeling confused and anxious. This is for those who are unsure of what step to take next. </p>
